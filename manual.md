## What is PinsaScript?
PinsaScript is a scripting language made to automatically manage files without having to do every operation manually.
It has a syntax which is heavely inspired from BASIC and Minecraft commands.
As a scripting language, it has a very small variety of instructions and is very easy to remember.
However, it is so reduced the only flow control it has is a very restrictive 'if' statement.
Also, it is not case-sensitive when it comes to instructions, but it is when it comes to attributes.

## Making a 'Hello, World' program
PinsaScript offers two different ways of making a 'Hello, World' program.
### With LOG instruction
The LOG instruction writes a message on the console. Making a 'Hello, World' with it is quite simple:
<pre>
log Hello, World
</pre>
And so, the output output will be:
<pre>
LOG: Hello, World
</pre>
### With NOTICE instruction
The NOTICE instruction works similarly to the LOG instruction, except it requires the user to press the RETURN key
in order to continue running the script.
A 'Hello, World' with it looks like:
<pre>
notice Hello, World
</pre>
So, the output is:
<pre>
NOTICE: Hello, World
[TO FINISH]
</pre>
